1. Install and Set up
2. Collect and label images

We're going to be collecting images using our webcam, but you could just as easily do this with you phone or pre process video

we'll be using a library called labelimg to label our images

Best practices for labeling: 
1. Case sensitive - watch out! - log it in your readme
2. include pictures of objects at different angles and under different light conditions
3. start with 10-20 pictures in each class
4. keep your labels as tight (minimum margins) as possible
